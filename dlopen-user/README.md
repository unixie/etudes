# dlopen-user
Making sure that an out-of-project can use `dlopen` etude as framework.

Used as an opportunity to play around with the wonderful [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI)

**Notes**

- Use is similar to `dlopen/install/bin/cli`
- Very basic TUI without error checking, so be careful with the arguments


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not designed for Windows, only unix with `dlfcn.h`
